# Situational Awareness Through Surveillance Data Analytics

This project aims to demonstrate how data analytics can be applied to surveillance data for improving situational awareness. By analyzing movement, noise levels, and temperature around sensitive areas, we detect potential anomalies that could indicate threats, enhancing decision-making for defense and security.

## Project Overview

The project involves analyzing simulated surveillance data to identify unusual patterns and detect potential threats. It showcases the use of data analytics to monitor borders and sensitive locations, providing insights that can help in enhancing national security.

## Tools & Technologies

- **Python**: The primary programming language for data processing and analysis.
- **pandas**: For data manipulation and analysis.
- **NumPy**: For numerical simulations.
- **Matplotlib**: For data visualization.
- **Seaborn**: For enhanced visualization.
- **Streamlit** (optional): For building a simple interactive dashboard.

## Dataset

The dataset simulates surveillance data, including information on movement counts, temperature, and noise levels at various locations. The data is saved in a CSV format with the following columns:

- `timestamp`: The date and time of the observation.
- `location_id`: The identifier for the surveillance location.
- `movement_count`: The count of detected movements at the location.
- `temperature`: The temperature recorded at the location.
- `noise_level`: The noise level at the location.
